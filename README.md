# group2-solid-project
Design of a bank based on SOLID principles.

The project proposal is to demonstrate a simple application of a Bank and its basic functionalities, namely: deposit, withdraw, last transaction and balance.
As the project was based on SOLID principles, all classes have a single purpose, can be extended but not modified and maintain a good level of abstraction and decoupling.
